# MASIV 2025 Intern Test ‚Äì Urban Design 3D Dashboard

This project is a full-stack urban dashboard that visualizes Calgary buildings in 3D using React Three Fiber. It includes an experimental natural language interface powered by a large language model (LLM) that converts queries like ‚Äúhighlight buildings over 100 feet‚Äù into structured filters.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Three.js via `@react-three/fiber`
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **LLM Integration**: Hugging Face Inference API (Mistral-7B)
- **Data Format**: GeoJSON (Calgary buildings)

NOTE: Due to GitHub‚Äôs 100 MB file limit, the `Buildings_20250414.geojson` file is not included in this repository.
